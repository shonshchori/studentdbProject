### About me

A former IDF officer, creative and motivated with strong analytical abilities and self-learning skills. Experience in team leadership and management under pressure. Multitasker with interpersonal communication and great teamwork skills.

:mortar_board: These days Iâ€™m working on my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Industrial engineering at Ariel university, while learning and extending my knowledge about the data science world.

âš¡ Fun fact: In my free time, my hobbies include running, reading, playing guitar and sometimes even drawing (although since i've started my studies, my iPad is used more as a notebook rather than a drawing canvas).
